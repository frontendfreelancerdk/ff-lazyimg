# ff-lazyimg
**An image lazyloader for Angular 7+**

Use this lazyloader when:
* You want to be able to lazy load your images
* You want to avoid pageheight changing and additional re-paints when you lazyload images
* You want more control over what image is load for different screensizes (e.g. when srcset does not behave)
* You want to control the order images is loaded in 

## Work in progress 
Save yourself some headaches and use another lazyloader until this readme changes
If you like headaches go ahead - the project is public and you can use it as you please.
